The African forest elephant is considerably smaller than the African bush elephant, though the size of the species has been subject to contradictory estimates. A 2000 study suggested that bulls of the species reach a shoulder height of 2.4–3.0 m (7 ft 10 in – 9 ft 10 in), and weighed 4–7 t (4.4–7.7 short tons), while cows were about 1.8–2.4 m (5 ft 11 in – 7 ft 10 in) tall at the shoulder and 2–4 t (2.2–4.4 short tons).[4] However, a 2003 study of forest elephants at a reserve in Gabon did not find any elephants taller than 2.16 m (7 ft 1 in).[10] A 2015 study alternately suggested that fully grown African forest elephant males in optimal condition were only on average 2.2 m (7 ft 3 in) tall and 2 t (2.2 short tons) in weight, with the largest individuals (representing less than 1 in 100,000 as a proportion of the total population) no bigger than 2.75 m (9 ft 0 in) tall and 3.5 t (3.9 short tons) in weight.[11]

The African forest elephant has grey skin, which looks yellow to reddish after wallowing. It is sparsely covered with black coarse hair, which is 20–200 mm (0.8–8 in) long around the tip of the tail. The length of the tail varies between individuals from half the height of the rump to almost touching ground. It has five toenails on the fore foot and four on the hind foot.[12] Its back is nearly straight.[4] Its oval-shaped ears have small elliptical-shaped tips,[3] and the tip of the trunk has two finger-like processes.[13]

The African forest elephant's tusks are straight and point downwards,[4] and are present in both males and females.[13] The African forest elephant has pink tusks, which are thinner and harder than the tusks of the African bush elephant. The length and diameter vary between individuals.[12] Tusks of bulls grow throughout life, tusks of cows cease growing when they are sexually mature.[4] The tusks are used to push through the dense undergrowth of their habitat.[14] The largest tusk recorded for the species is 2.41 m (7 ft 11 in) long and 60 kg (130 lb) in weight. A larger tusk measuring 2.96 m (9 ft 9 in) long and weighing 70 kg (150 lb) has been recorded, but this may belong to a forest-bush elephant hybrid. The average tusk size is uncertain due to measurements historically being lumped in with those of African bush elephants, but based on the sizes of the largest known tusks may be in the region of 1.6–2 m (5 ft 3 in – 6 ft 7 in) and 25–30 kg (55–66 lb).
